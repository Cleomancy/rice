# RICE MY LINUX
like pimp my ride

I use DWM and friends to make my pc look pretty, This is my preconfigured build

Artix linux has now disabled 3rd party repos since June 2021 that's why there are two scripts, one specifically for artix and one for arch based distros.
Use them accordingly.

You may want to change the keyboard layout in the .xinitrc


PREREQ. xorg-server, xorg-xinit, libxinerama, libxft, feh, unclutter, ttf-font-awesome and a ttf of your choice I personally use ttf-hack but you can change that in the script (xorg-xbacklight for laptops)


Feel free to use it.
