# RICE MY LINUX
like pimp my ride

I use DWM and friends to make my pc look pretty, This is my preconfigured build

rice.sh is made for arch base distros so you'll probably have to install the dependencies yourself ALSO you may want to change the keyboard layout in the .xinitrc


PREREQ. xorg-server, xorg-xinit, libxinerama, libxft, feh, unclutter and ttf-font-awesome (xorg-xbacklight for laptops)


Feel free to use it.
